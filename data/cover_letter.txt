Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in earnest appeal regarding the processing of the I-130 petition for my 9-year-old daughter, [Child’s Name], who has Down syndrome. I am respectfully requesting expedited processing of her petition based on humanitarian grounds.

[Child’s Name] was diagnosed with Down syndrome at birth, and her condition requires specialized care and attention. Due to her developmental and medical needs, her presence in the United States is essential for accessing the necessary medical services, educational opportunities, and familial support that are crucial for her well-being and development.

As her parent and guardian, I am deeply concerned about [Child’s Name]’s current situation. The prolonged separation from her family and the delay in her immigration process are causing immense stress and uncertainty for her and our entire family. Moreover, the lack of access to appropriate medical care and support systems in our home country poses significant risks to her health and overall quality of life.

I humbly request your compassionate consideration of our circumstances and ask for expedited processing of [Child’s Name]’s I-130 petition. Doing so would alleviate the undue hardship and anxiety that we are currently experiencing and allow us to provide [Child’s Name] with the care and support she urgently needs.

Enclosed with this letter are supporting documents, including medical records, demonstrating [Child’s Name]’s condition and the necessity of her expedited immigration process.

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and trust in your understanding of the urgency of our situation. Should you require any further information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address].

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
